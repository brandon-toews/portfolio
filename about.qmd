Currently in my final year of an Artificial Intelligence BSc degree. With a backdrop of years in the workforce, I'm embarking on an exciting journey to dive deep into the realm of Artificial Intelligence. My career shift isn't just about a change---it's about a genuine passion for learning new things. I've found immense joy in unraveling the mysteries of AI, blending the wisdom of experience with the curiosity of a beginner.
