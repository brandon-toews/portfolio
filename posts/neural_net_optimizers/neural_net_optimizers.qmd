## Custom Optimizers
### Genetic Algorithm
  - **Functions**:
    - **`__init__`**: Initializes the optimizer with a given model, population size, mutation rate, and weight range.
    - **`_get_model_parameters`**: Retrieves the model parameters as a list of numpy arrays.
    - **`_set_model_parameters`**: Sets the model parameters from a given list of numpy arrays.
    - **`generate_population`**: Generates an initial population of solutions with random weights.
    - **`fitness_function`**: Calculates the fitness of a model based on the inverse of the loss function.
    - **`layer_crossover`**: Performs uniform crossover between two parent solutions at the layer level.
    - **`neuron_crossover`**: Performs uniform crossover between two parent solutions at the neuron level.
    - **`mutate`**: Mutates a given solution by randomly altering its weights.
    - **`step`**: Executes one iteration of the genetic algorithm, involving evaluation of the population, selection of the best individuals, and creation of a new population through crossover and mutation.
  - **Usage in Models**:
    - **`Mnist_GA_Model`**: Trains a PyTorch model for the MNIST dataset.
    - **`XOR_GA_Model`**: Trains a PyTorch model for the XOR problem.

    - **`generate_particles`**: Generates a swarm of particles with random positions and velocities.
    - **`objective_function`**: Calculates the objective value (loss) of a model.
    - **`clip_move`**: Moves a particle with clipping.
    - **`move`**: Moves a particle without clipping.
    - **`step`**: Executes one iteration of the particle swarm optimization algorithm, involving updating the velocity and position of each particle based on cognitive and social components.
  - **Usage in Models**:
    - **`Mnist_PSO_Model`**: Trains a PyTorch model for the MNIST dataset.
    - **`XOR_PSO_Model`**: Trains a PyTorch model for the XOR problem.
