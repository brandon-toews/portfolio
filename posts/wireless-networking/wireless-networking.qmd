## Expand To Learn About Project Scenario

Acme Corp. is a company located on the 6th floor of the Landmark 2 building in Kelowna, BC. Acme has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Centre for Arts and Technology, located in the Landmark 3 building, for the shared use of some of CAT’s facilities during night-time hours when the facilities are otherwise unused.

Acme has requested that you design the technology infrastructure required to connect Landmark 2 and Landmark 3 with a point-to-point WLAN connection, as well as provide WLAN coverage for CAT’s space on the ground floor of Landmark 3.

In order to demonstrate your design, you are required to provide mock-ups of certain aspects of your design as outlined. In addition to the mock-ups, you are required to provide a full planning document outlining the results of your research and details of your proposed solution.
