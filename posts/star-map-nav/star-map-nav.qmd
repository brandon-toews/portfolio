**Instructions**\
Use the camera controls to look around the generated galaxy and use the mouse to select stars by clicking on them. When two stars have been selected the shortest path between them is drawn and the path/distances are displayed to the user in the UI. To deselect stars click on anything that isn't a star. Press `Space` to regenerate a new galaxy.

# Star Map Navigation Simulation

Project to implement a star map navigation style simulation using the Unity Games Engine all written in C#. Mathematical programming techniques were used to craft a custom pathfinding djikstra script to chart shortest path from user selected stars. I created custom math methods to perform various calculations involving matrices and incorporated custom lerp libraries and UI scripts from my previous [Modes of Motion](https://brandon-toews.github.io/portfolio/posts/modes-of-motion/modes-of-motion.html) Unity project.
